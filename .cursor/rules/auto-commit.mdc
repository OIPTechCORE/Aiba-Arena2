# Auto-Commit Updates

**After making file changes, automatically commit them.**

- When you add, edit, or delete files in the project, stage and commit the changes.
- Use a clear, descriptive commit message that summarizes what was changed (e.g. "Add University plan section", "Fix lint in page.js").
- Request `git_write` permission when running `git add` and `git commit`.
- Do not push to remote unless the user explicitly asks to push.

This keeps the repo up to date with every update you make.
