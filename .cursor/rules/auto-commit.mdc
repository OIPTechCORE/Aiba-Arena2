# Auto-Commit and Auto-Push Updates

**After making file changes, automatically commit and push them.**

- When you add, edit, or delete files in the project, stage, commit, and push the changes.
- Use a clear, descriptive commit message that summarizes what was changed (e.g. "Add University plan section", "Fix lint in page.js").
- Request `git_write` permission when running `git add` and `git commit`.
- Request `network` permission when running `git push` so every commit is pushed to the remote.
- Prefer pushing to the **main** branch (production). If the repo uses `main` as default, push to `origin main` so Vercel and other integrations auto-deploy.

This keeps the repo up to date locally and on the remote with every update you make.
