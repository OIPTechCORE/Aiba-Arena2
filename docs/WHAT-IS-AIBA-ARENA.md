# What is AIBA Arena?

A deep, from-zero explanation of the product for players, partners, and developers.

**Last updated:** Feb 2025

## In one sentence

**AIBA Arena** is a Telegram Mini App where you own AI brokers, compete in battle arenas, and earn in-app and on-chain rewards (NEUR, AIBA, Stars, Diamonds) while trading, staking, and governing the ecosystem.

---

## Who is it for?

- **Players** who want a play-to-earn game with strategy (brokers, arenas, racing, guilds, tournaments).
- **Collectors** who want to own and trade brokers, cars, bikes, and NFTs.
- **Community** who want referrals, trainers, guilds, charity, and DAO governance.
- **Developers** who want to extend the platform (e.g. add other games via the “More games” hub).

---

## Core idea

1. **Own** — You get AI brokers (and optionally cars and bikes). Brokers have stats (intelligence, speed, risk) and energy. You can create them (free starter or pay with TON), buy/sell on the marketplace, or get them from the system shop.
2. **Compete** — You choose an arena (e.g. prediction, simulation, guild wars) and run battles. Outcomes are simulated in a deterministic way; your broker’s stats and a fair seed decide the result.
3. **Earn** — You earn NEUR and AIBA (in-app currencies), plus Stars and Diamonds for achievements. You can claim AIBA on-chain via a TON wallet, stake AIBA for yield, and use it in the marketplace and DAO.
4. **Extend** — The app is built so more games and mini-apps can be added to one place (e.g. “More games” tab), similar to LoveBank or Hamster Kombat.

## Where do you play?

- **Telegram:** Open the AIBA Arena Mini App from the bot or link. No separate install.
- **Web (if deployed):** Same app can be opened in a browser; Telegram auth may still be used for full features.
