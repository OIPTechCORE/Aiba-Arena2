<h1>What is AIBA Arena?</h1>
<p>A deep, from-zero explanation of the product for players, partners, and developers.</p>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> Feb 2025</p>
<hr/>
<h2>In one sentence</h2>
<p><strong>AIBA Arena</strong> is a Telegram Mini App where you own AI brokers, compete in battle arenas, and earn in-app and on-chain rewards (NEUR, AIBA, Stars, Diamonds) while trading, staking, and governing the ecosystem.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Who is it for?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collectors</strong> who want to own and trade brokers, cars, bikes, and NFTs.</li>
<li><strong>Community</strong> who want referrals, trainers, guilds, charity, and DAO governance.</li>
<li><strong>Developers</strong> who want to extend the platform (e.g. add other games via the “More games” hub).</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2>Core idea</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compete</strong> — You choose an arena (e.g. prediction, simulation, guild wars) and run battles. Outcomes are simulated in a deterministic way; your broker’s stats and a fair seed decide the result.</li>
<li><strong>Earn</strong> — You earn NEUR and AIBA (in-app currencies), plus Stars and Diamonds for achievements. You can claim AIBA on-chain via a TON wallet, stake AIBA for yield, and use it in the marketplace and DAO.</li>
<li><strong>Extend</strong> — The app is built so more games and mini-apps can be added to one place (e.g. “More games” tab), similar to LoveBank or Hamster Kombat.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h2>Where do you play?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web (if deployed):</strong> Same app can be opened in a browser; Telegram auth may still be used for full features.</li>
</ul>
